Welcome to my rudimentary golf simulator!

In this game, you will play 9 holes on a randomly generated course. You will face 2 par 3s, 2 par 5s, and 5 par 4s of random distances.

You'll have a set of 6 clubs to choose from: Driver, Low Iron, Mid Iron, High Iron, Gap Wedge, & Lob Wedge. Each shot will go a random distance within a fixed distance range for each club.

Once you get to less than 20 yards from the hole, you will be on the green and the program will automatically putt you out, using a randomly generated number of putts between 1-3, inclusive.

You'll have a rolling scorecard that will update you after every hole. 

Have fun, and let me know any feedback. Enjoy!
